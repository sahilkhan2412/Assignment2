# Even or Odd Checker 
This Python program determines whether a given integer is even or odd.

## Problem Statement 
Write a Python program that:

1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks if the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

## How to Run 
1. *Save:* Save the following code in a file named Task_1.py.
2. *Run:* Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the program using the command: Task_1.py


# Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 
## Problem Statement 
This program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop in Python.

## How it Works 
1. *Initialization*: A variable sum is initialized to 0 to store the cumulative sum.
2. *Iteration*: A for loop iterates through a sequence of numbers from 1 to 50 (inclusive) using range(1, 51).
3. *Accumulation*: In each iteration, the current number is added to sum.
4. *Output*: After the loop completes, the final 'sum` is displayed.

## How to Run 
1. *Save:* Save the following code in a file named Task_2.py.
2. *Run:* Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the program using the command: `Task_2.py
